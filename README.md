# System Design and Business Analytics Case
## Case Description
Jim Sotheby spent a lifetime building successful businesses. Even as a kid, he had the biggest lemonade stand on the block, then opened 3 other ones on different blocks (with other kids working for him). Jim has had success building brokerages and real estate firms.

 What most people don’t know about Jim is that he is a master chess player. He now wants to turn his attention to building a web site for master level chess players to play each other.  He not only sees this as a fun venture, but also one he can make money with. He is calling this site Chess Giants. The only problem is that Jim hasn’t really worked much with IT and has never been the “stakeholder” for a site. He’s hoping for some guidance from the IT firm he will select to build the site.  Jim also travels a lot - unexpectedly, so his time to meet with the IT may be limited.


This site will only allow people to sign up if they have a chess rating of 2200 or higher on the www.uschess.org site. Members can apply for membership but only someone at Chess giants can approve them to become a member if they meet that criteria. Ultimately he would like to have Chess Giants automatically retrieve the rating from www.USchess.org but he’s not sure if that can even be done, so he will settle for a manual process now if it can’t quickly be automated (maybe this can be done later on). Jim will charge an annual fee of 1500 dollar to become a member. Jim wants to keep the budget to 500,000.


Members can play chess by signing on and finding other players who are also online and challenging them to a game. They can also search for players in the members list and sending them challenges via email.


Jim also wants to keep a history of all games that have been played (including each move). He also wants the ability to post the “top 10” of players who have won the most games – so they will need to track the record of games won and lost for each player.


Jim also wants the ability for members to post comments on games after they have been completed, so that the members can share ideas. Jim knows that people can get emotional sharing their ideas on chess, so he wants administrative functions to be able to delete posts and also to suspend or remove a member if need be.

 The actual chess game will be played on the site, with software that will be purchased to conduct the actual game. This software is called ChessMaster and it will integrate with the site seamlessly. It will get launched within the site as players initiate a game. Unfortunately, none of the technical staff in your organization knows how to integrate this, so this is another concern.


The CEO of this new site, Jim Sotheby will be appearing at our class with two business analysts to go through the analysis. The CEO believes in this venture and believes that he will get great market share and thinks he can even become a leader in the industry.

## Case Requirements
My job in this project as the business analyst:

1) Create a decomposition diagram of the business.

What are the major areas of this business? how do they break out into processes?


2) Create a BRD

Make sure each area of the business is recognized with requirements that can carry through all the way to the use case. For non-functional requirements, think of what the site will need. The BRD should include all elements of the scope document (goals, objectives, risks, constraints, scope items, out of scope items).

3) Create Activity Diagrams

Pick two of the functional areas (EXCEPT ADMIN) and create process flows for them. Choose carefully, as you will be using these down the chain of analysis stages.


4) Create a data model for the two process flows you have created

 
5) Create Wireframes for the two processes.


6) Use case statements
